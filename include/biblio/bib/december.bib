	abstract = {In this work, an ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) system was employed to investigate the fast-kinetic reactive crystallization process of calcium carbonate. USCT measurements and reconstruction provided key insights into the bulk particle distribution inside the stirred tank reactor and could be used to estimate the settling rate and settling time of the particles. To establish the utility of the USCT system for dynamical crystallization processes, first, the experimental imaging tasks were carried out with the stirred solid beads, as well as the feeding and stirring of the CaCO3 crystals. The feeding region, the mixing process, and the particles settling time could be detected from USCT data. Reactive crystallization experiments for CO2 capture were then conducted. Moreover, there was further potential for quantitative characterization of the suspension density in this process. USCT-based reconstructions were investigated for several experimental scenarios and operating conditions. This study demonstrates a real-time monitoring and fault detection application of USCT for reactive crystallization processes. As a robust noninvasive and nonintrusive tool, real-time signal analysis and reconstruction can be beneficial in the development of monitoring and control systems with real-world applications for crystallization processes. A diverse range of experimental studies shown here demonstrate the versatility of the USCT system in process application, hoping to unlock the commercial and industrial utility of the USCT devices.},

	abstract = {When undergoing compression during oral processing, stacked gels display different mechanical properties that shape perceptions of texture contrasts (Santagiuliana et al., 2018). However, to date, characterizing the mechanical responses of individual gel layers has been impossible. In this study, an ultrasound (US) technique was developed, that allowed such deformation dynamics to be visualized in real time. Stacked gels were created using layers (height: 5 mm) of brittle agar and elastic gelatin in different combinations. In a series of experimental tests, different stacked gel combinations were placed on a rough, deformable artificial tongue model (ATM) made of polyvinyl alcohol; a texture analyzer was used to apply uniaxial force, and deformation was monitored by an US transducer (5 MHz) located under the ATM., From the obtained results, it was observed that the deformation of ATM surface during compression was in accordance with the force recorded by the texture analyzer, suggesting a collaborative response of different layers under compression. Moreover, US imaging revealed that differences in Young's modulus values between layers led to heterogeneous strain distributions, which were more pronounced for the agar layers. Biopolymer elasticity was also a key factor. Regardless of combination type, the gelatin layers never fractured; such was not the case for the agar layers, especially those with lower Young's modulus values. The results of this US study have thus paved the way for a better understanding of the mechanical deformation that occurs in heterogeneous foods, a phenomenon that has been difficult to examine because of the limitations of conventional techniques.,

	abstract = {Ultrasound is a popular and affordable imaging modality, but the nature of freehand ultrasound operation leads to unknown applied loads at non-quantifiable angles. The purpose of this paper was to demonstrate an instrumentation strategy for an ultrasound system to measure probe forces and orientation during freehand imaging to characterize the interaction between the probe and soft-tissue as well as enhance repeatability. The instrumentation included a 6-axis load cell, an inertial measurement unit, and an optional sensor for camera-based motion capture. A known method for compensation of the ultrasound probe weight was implemented, and a novel method for temporal synchronization was developed. While load and optical sensing was previously achieved, this paper presents a strategy for potential instrumentation on a variety of ultrasound machines. A key feature was the temporal synchronization, utilizing the electrocardiogram (EKG) feature built-in to the ultrasound. The system was used to perform anatomical imaging of tissue layers of musculoskeletal extremities and imaging during indentation on an in vivo subject and an in vitro specimen. The outcomes of the instrumentation strategy were demonstrated during minimal force and indentation imaging. In short, the system presented robust instrumentation of an existing ultrasound system to fully characterize the probe force, orientation, and optionally its movement during imaging while efficiently synchronizing all data. Researchers may use the instrumentation strategy on any EKG capable ultrasound systems if mechanical characterization of soft tissue or minimization of forces and deformations of tissue during anatomical imaging are desired.},

	abstract = {An in vitro study was conducted to further explore the potential of an emerging ultrasound method for monitoring in real time the progress of the contact between gels with different physical properties and tongue mimicking surfaces (TMSs) during uniaxial compressions. A 1-MHz ultrasound transducer was used to measure the apparent reflection coefficient (R*) of the interface between TMSs (of varied roughness) and gels (agar and/or gelatin). The patterns of R* variations clearly depended on the gels capacity to deform and mold the asperities of the TMSs during compression. Rough TMSs induced a significant decline of R* values, demonstrating an increase of the fraction of the TMSs in direct contact with the gels. Rigidity, fracture properties or adhesion energy of gels influenced the kinetics of contact progress and associated patterns of R* variations. Moreover, the presence of a thick lubrication film between the gels and the TMSs promoted the transmission of ultrasound waves (acting as a coupling agent) and led to decreasing values of R*. Such phenomena were observed both when depositing a water lubrication film of controlled thickness on the TMSs (to mimic salivary film) and when considering gels with high water release capacities. The study confirms the potential of ultrasound methods for exploring physical phenomena related to interactions between food and tongue surface. Such developments could better contribute to unravel the determinants of texture perceptions during food oral processing.},

In this paper we describe a FPGA-based 64-channels reception board of an ultrasound research platform with real-time processing developed by the Brazilian Network of Ultrasound Techniques (RBTU) to facilitate research in US in Brazil. This platform is composed of two 32 channels transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) plus synchronism and control boards. Data from TX/RX modules are transferred via two USB 3.0 interfaces and processed in a PC with GPU processor board. We present the Platform User Interface and B-Mode images obtained with linear and convex array transducers without any artifact or speckle reduction techniques.

Sonoporation combines ultrasound (US) and microbubbles to increase the permeability of cell membranes. We assessed gemcitabine uptake combined with sonoporation in vitro in three PDAC cell lines (BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1). Cells were cultured in hypoxic bioreactors, while gemcitabine incubation \&plusmn; sonoporation was conducted in cells with operational or inhibited nucleoside membrane transporters. Intracellular active metabolite (dFdCTP), extracellular gemcitabine, and inactive metabolite (dFdU) concentrations were measured with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Sonoporation with increasing US intensities resulted in decreasing extracellular gemcitabine concentrations in all three cell lines with inhibited membrane transporters. In cells with inhibited membrane transporters, without sonoporation, dFdCTP concentrations were reduced down to 10\% of baseline. Sonoporation partially restored gemcitabine uptake in these cells, as indicated by a moderate increase in dFdCTP concentrations (up to 37\% of baseline) in MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1. In BxPC-3, gemcitabine was effectively inactivated to dFdU, which might represent a protective mechanism against dFdCTP accumulation in these cells. Intracellular dFdCTP concentrations did not change significantly following sonoporation in any of the cell lines with operational membrane transporters, indicating that the gemcitabine activation pathway may have been saturated with the drug. Sonoporation allowed a moderate increase in gemcitabine transmembrane uptake in all three cell lines, but pre-existing nucleoside transporters were the major determinants of gemcitabine uptake and retention.},

	abstract = {Tumors with anisotropy in their structural properties experience unpredictable and asymmetric growth along certain directions that can vary over time during the tumor progression. An early recognition of such anisotropy could provide information about their malignity, facilitating early diagnostics/prognostic. However, it is difficult to be observed by classic echography. Diverse studies of the literature show 3D images of elastic properties in media with anisotropy in a certain direction, but are transversely isotropic. However, for highly anisotropy media this assumption is no longer valid and requires specific measurements of shear velocities in the 3D directions. These media with 21 independent elastic material parameters and no symmetry plane. Techniques using ultrafast focused sound scanners present difficulties in covering immediate regions around the focused area and specific information for different incident beam orientations to obtain complete 3D spatial information, which is relevant in these types of media without planes of symmetry. It is the case of malignant tumors. The current paper presents a flexible spatial study of mechanical displacements induced in highly anisotropic soft media by low frequency shaker (including printed inorganic, pseudo-organic grids and cow fiber tissues respectively). Homogeneous and heterogeneous media without planes of symmetry have been tested in the experiments by using speckle ultrasonic interferometry. Velocities associated to the induced low frequency-mechanical displacements have been analyzed at a point of interest within the sample from different angles of propagation, covering a 3D angular space. These measurements show a high spatial-dependence of results, demonstrating the relevance of making spatial angular scans to derive parameters related to the anisotropy. This technique allows detection of anisotropies in small areas of analysis, even if they are weak.},

	abstract = {Ultrasound phantoms are commonly used to assess the performance of ultrasound systems and ensure their proper functionality, in addition to providing opportunities for medical training. However, Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) phantoms, in particular, are prohibitively expensive and procedure specific. This work explores the use of additive manufacturing to fabricate a patient-specific, full-scale torso ultrasound phantom. Phantom geometry was derived from anonymized computed tomography scans and segments into discrete organs. The digital organs (torso, skeleton, liver, spleen) were 3-D printed and used as castable molds for producing their respective body features. These organs were integrated with artificial hemorrhages to produce a realistic training tool for FAST scans. The resulting phantom is low in cost, has a verified shelf-life of at least 1 y and was positively reviewed by a trauma and emergency radiologist for its ability to provide accurate geometric and ultrasound information.},

Most ultrasound imaging systems have been developed with the aim of achieving a high signal-to-noise ratio for good image quality. As miniaturization and portability of the systems are pursued recently, high energy efficiency is of great need. In the ultrasonic imaging systems, the most power-hungry block is typically the pulser that drives the ultrasound transducer at a high voltage. To better understand the pulser's operation and power consumption, an equivalent circuit model of the transducer is introduced. Based on the model, we investigate the fundamentals of pulser driving methods and review the conventional class-D pulser as well as state-of-the-art pulsers with dynamic power loss reduction techniques. Their operation principles, strengths, and limitations are analyzed and discussed in depth.},

	abstract = {Fetal heart rate (fHR) monitoring using Doppler Ultrasound (US) is a standard method to assess fetal health before and during labor. Typically, an US transducer is positioned on the maternal abdomen and directed towards the fetal heart. Due to fetal movement or displacement of the transducer, the relative fetal heart location (fHL) with respect to the US transducer can change, leading to frequent periods of signal loss. Consequently, frequent repositioning of the US transducer is required, which is a cumbersome task affecting clinical workflow. In this research, a new flexible US transducer array is proposed which allows for measuring the fHR independently of the fHL. In addition, a method for dynamic adaptation of the transmission power of this array is introduced with the aim of reducing the total acoustic dose transmitted to the fetus and the associated power consumption, which is an important requirement for application in an ambulatory setting. The method is evaluated using an in-vitro setup of a beating chicken heart. We demonstrate that the signal quality of the Doppler signal acquired with the proposed method is comparable to that of a standard, clinical US transducer. At the same time, our transducer array is able to measure the fHR for varying fHL while only using 50\% of the total transmission power of standard, clinical US transducers.},

	doi = {10.1121/1.4928396},
	abstract = {Overall, results suggest that holography can be implemented successfully as a metrological tool with small, quantifiable errors. Acoustic holography is a powerful technique for characterizing ultrasound sources and the fields they radiate, with the ability to quantify source vibrations and reduce the number of required measurements. These capabilities are increasingly appealing for meeting measurement standards in medical ultrasound; however, associated uncertainties have not been investigated systematically. Here errors associated with holographic representations of a linear, continuous-wave ultrasound field are studied. To facilitate the analysis, error metrics are defined explicitly, and a detailed description of a holography formulation based on the Rayleigh integral is provided. Errors are evaluated both for simulations of a typical therapeutic ultrasound source and for physical experiments with three different ultrasound sources. Simulated experiments explore sampling errors introduced by the use of a finite number of measurements, geometric uncertainties in the actual positions of acquired measurements, and uncertainties in the properties of the propagation medium. Results demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of keeping errors less than about 1\%. Typical errors in physical experiments were somewhat larger, on the order of a few percent; comparison with simulations provides specific guidelines for improving the experimental implementation to reduce these errors. Overall, results suggest that holography can be implemented successfully as a metrological tool with small, quantifiable errors.},
