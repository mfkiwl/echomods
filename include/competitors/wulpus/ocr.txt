1 Introduction
3 Results
4 Comparison to state of the art
Background and Motivation: has
.8 channels actuated simultaneously to emit plane-waves with increased transmit energy (+15 V pulses)
A summary of alternative devices from industry
and academia:
Single-channel ADC read-out at a time up to 8 MSPS Configurable frame rate up to 50 Hz in high-throughput BLE data streaming mode (~320 kbps)
⚫
Wearable A-mode Ultrasound (US)

for continuous on-body monitoring of vital signs
• Recent works successfully applied A-mode Ultrasound gesture
for artery monitoring [1] and hand recognition [2]

Either they are specialized for a single task and
closed, or they exceed the power and form factor
constraints
WULPUS satisfies all requirements for a truly wearable long-term monitoring system.
