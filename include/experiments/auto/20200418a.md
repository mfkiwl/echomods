## [Data](/matty/20200418a/data/) acquired

* Data1 was done to explore the data: field of view, rotation period.
* Data2 is data OK, adjusted in terms of time
* Data3 is like data2, but at 64Msps, all depth
* Data4 is like data2, 64Msps, only first points per line 
* Data5 introduced an extra cable
* Data6 to 13 have been made to test effect of the pulse width
* Data 14 and 15 are 400ns pulses
* Data16 is 500ns, data17 is 200ns wide
* Difference between 16 and 17 is only width of pulse

The JSONs were processed and saved as pickles with [this notebook](/matty/20200418a/20200418a-MakePkls.ipynb) (pickles not pushed on github because too heavy) and processed in [here](/matty/20200418a/20200418a-Process.ipynb).
