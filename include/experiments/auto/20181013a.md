# Testing hp2121  `20181013a`

## Overview

* Head is a bit sticky, but cleanable and clean
* Small buble inside = no need to refill the head
* limited number of pins... with a connector with screws. Opened:
  * 3 sets of coax
  * 1 pair of black/white cables
  * Few cables for an EEPROM

## Test by multimeter

* 3 pairs of coax : low impedance: 3 piezos?
* Test with a set of modules: only yellow cable
* Impedance between black and white cables is that of a motor. To try. 5V applied shift the piezo.

## Test of motor

* Using still [KretzControl](/include/images/kretzaw145ba/20180812a/KretzControl.ino)
* Using M1 at high for slowing down. 50ms period (20fps).
