# Running tests of the new modules `20180415r`

### Setup

#### Required modules 

* [doj](/doj/) as a motherboard
* [elmo](/elmo/) for acquisition
* [lite.tbo](/lite.tbo/) as the pulser
* [goblin](/goblin/) as the analog processing board
* [wirephantom](/wirephantom/) as a target
* A piezo, which an be replaced by a [probe](/include/probes/auto/retroATL3.md), folder for details here](/retroATL3/).

#### Is it compatible with the probe acquisition ?

__Yes!__ This setup can easily be used to replicate the probe image acquisition displayed in [20170715-ProbeTest.ipynb](/elmo/data/20170715-ProbeTest.ipynb) by plugging the probe BNC onto the tobo board.

Only code concerns the _Raspberry Pi drivers_ for acquisition (see below) as well as the post processing (see the previous link). One needs to shoot more lines to rebuild the image.
